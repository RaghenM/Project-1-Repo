# Background
Obesity is know to be a very complex social health issue with many confounding factors. We wanted to look at another popular metric in discussion nowadays, walkability, and its effects on obesity rates for US cities. We will be comparing obesity rates for various different metrics including income, walkability, and winter length to determine how much of an effect walkability has on obesity.

# Project Description and Questions
Walkability has become a very talked about topic when it comes to city planning and even when considering places to live. Younger people are becoming very concerned about it. How important is walkability when it comes to population healthcare dynamics, in this case obesity. We also wanted to look at confounding factors (in this case income or average weather).

-	How is city walkability correlated with obesity rate in over 18 adults?
-	How does income level change obesity rate when it is controlled for?
-	Does winter length have an effect on obesity rate when walkability is controlled for?
  o	What about walkability? Does weather effect it?
